Hi my friends,

The README.md file contains a comprehensive description about how the application works.

As you see the main perpose of this console application is to illustrate some fundamental things of c# like switch statement, if statement and etcetera.

My plan is applying SOLID principle and do refactoring as much as I can to the application.

This repository is open to collaborate.

Have a good time.
